// Notes:
// 1. This is a special member function with same name as class with ~ at front.
// 2. Used to destruct the memory of object which was constructed by constructor.
// 3. Destructors get called automatically(implicit call),as constructor was.
// 4. We can call destructors explicitly but that is not good practice.
// 5.The only place where we can call destructors explicitly is after placement of new.

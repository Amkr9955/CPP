//A Binary Tree is labeled if every node is assigned a label and a Binary Tree is unlabelled if nodes are not assigned any label. 
// Below two are considered same unlabelled trees
//     o                 o
//   /   \             /   \ 
//  o     o           o     o 

// Below two are considered different labelled trees
//     A                C
//   /   \             /  \ 
//  B     C           A    B 

// How many different Unlabelled Binary Trees can be there with n nodes? 
//  T(n) = (2n)! / (n+1)!n!  known as n'th Catalan Number

//Number of Labelled Trees = (Number of unlabelled trees) * n!
//                         = [(2n)! / (n+1)!n!]  Ã— n!
